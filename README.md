# Introduction

This is a personal project for a learning platform app. The idea isn't new; I'm just using the opportunity to brush up my overall programming experience, while giving myself an goal (i.e. to finish this app).

# Phase 1 TODO

- OK Install react
- OK Install webpack
- OK Install babel
- OK Configure babel to resolve js files
- OK Configure webpack to use babel-loader
- OK Add eslint + airbnb rules
- OK Add prettier
- OK Add jest
- Convert project to TypeScript

Notes: Each npm library evolves over time, so there is never a tutorial that can smoothly get you up and running in 5 minutes (unless the tutorial was written recently). Best way is to refer to points above, and install each library separately according to each of their "Installation Guide".

# Phase 2 TODO

- Setup server (?)
- Setup database (?)
- Setup GraphQL (?)

# Phase 3 TODO

- Setup Selenium

# Phase 4 TODO

- Implement app features (TBD)
- Add redux + thunk
- Add CSS loaders
- Add image/file loaders
- Add code splitting

# Phase 5 TODO

- Get hosting & domain name
- Deploy
