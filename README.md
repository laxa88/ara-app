# Introduction

This is a personal project for a learning platform app. The idea isn't new; I'm just using the opportunity to brush up my overall programming experience, while giving myself an goal (i.e. to finish this app).

# Phase 1 TODO

- OK Install react
- OK Install webpack
- OK Install babel
- OK Configure babel to resolve js files
- OK Configure webpack to use babel-loader
- OK Add eslint + airbnb rules
- OK Add prettier
- OK Add jest
- OK Convert project to TypeScript
- OK Add jest for typescript
- Convert eslint to tslint

Notes: Each npm library evolves over time, so there is never a tutorial that can smoothly get you up and running in 5 minutes (unless the tutorial was written recently). Best way is to refer to points above, and install each library separately according to each of their "Installation Guide".

- OK Setup database
- OK Setup API
- OK Add eslint + airbnb rules
- OK Add prettier
- Add jest for typescript

# Phase 4 TODO
