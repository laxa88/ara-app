# Introduction

This is a full server/client practice project for my local community.

## Problem

Everyone is currently using a single Whatsapp chatroom to share important news AND have small chit-chats. Important messages like maintenance payments, receipts and announcements are difficult to find.

## Solution

Write an single-page app with the following features:
- Upload and approve community-related payments
- And simple blog system for committees to post news and announcements

That way, the Whatsapp group can be be safely used exclusively for casual banter.
